# Store listing: Modrinth, CurseForge and Nexus Mods

Everything to fill in on the three platforms, field by field. Not shipped in the jar, and a
change here does not trigger a release (`**.md` is ignored by `release.yml`).

Do first: **make the GitHub repository public.** It is private today, and a project
with a source link that leads nowhere will be refused or distrusted.

## One project

**Living Horizon** (the mod): the jar, on the clients and, to share the positions, on the
server. There is no data pack any more: a data pack project published before is to be
archived, with a note that the mod on the server replaces it.

## Modrinth: the mod

Create > Project > **Mod**.

Versions: one per jar, that is one per game version and loader (Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge,
Forge; the tables of `stonecutter.properties.toml`). The release workflow uploads them all
once `MODRINTH_TOKEN` and `MODRINTH_ID` exist; create the project by hand first, to have
the id. What each version gets:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Version title | `Living Horizon 0.1.0 (1.21.11)` on Fabric, `(Quilt 1.21.11)`, `(NeoForge 1.21.11)`, `(Forge 1.21.11)` on the others |
| Release channel | **Beta** below 1.0.0; **Alpha** for the targets not yet seen drawing in a world (`mod.release_type`) |
| Loaders | the jar's own: Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge or Forge |
| Game versions | the `mod.mc_releases` of its table (1.20 to 1.21.11, 26.1 to 26.3) |
| Dependencies | Fabric and Quilt: Fabric API **Required**, Voxy **Optional**. Every loader: Distant Horizons **Optional** |
| Changelog | a link to the GitHub release |

## CurseForge: the mod

Create > Project > Class **Mods** (Minecraft).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project name | `Living Horizon` |
| Slug | `living-horizon` |
| Summary (200 to stay safe) | `Shows mobs and players far past your render distance, on the game's terrain and on Voxy and Distant Horizons terrain, with birds in the sky.` |
| Main category | **Cosmetic** |

| Description | the block below, pasted in the editor |
| Logo | `src/main/resources/assets/livinghorizon/icon.png` (512x512) |
| Links | Source and Issues as above; Donation: your link |
| Allow others to distribute | leave **allowed**: the license allows the unchanged jar in modpacks, with credit |
| Environment | **Client** and **Server** (the server side is optional) |

Files: one per jar, uploaded by the release workflow once `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN` and
`CURSEFORGE_ID` exist, with the same title, release type, loader and game versions as on
Modrinth, plus **Client** and the Java version (17 up to 1.20.4, 21 up to 1.21.11, 25 for
26.x). Relations: Fabric API required on Fabric and Quilt; Voxy and Distant Horizons
optional, where they have a CurseForge page.

CurseForge reviews a new project before it goes public; it takes from hours to days.

## Nexus Mods: the mod

The API cannot create a page: create it by hand, once, under the game **Minecraft** (domain
`minecraft`; Nexus has no separate Java or Bedrock game). The page is
`https://www.nexusmods.com/minecraft/mods/1376`, so the repository variable `NEXUSMODS_ID` is
`1376`, beside the `NEXUSMODS_TOKEN` secret (an API key from the account's settings).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | `Living Horizon` |
| Category | **Miscellaneous** (no category fits a client-side visual mod better) |
| Summary | the CurseForge one |
| Description | the block below, in Nexus's editor (BBCode: headings and lists by hand) |
| Requirements | Fabric API (off-site link to Modrinth), noted "Fabric and Quilt only"; Voxy, Distant Horizons and Mod Menu as optional, in the description |
| Permissions | the Living Horizon License: no modified upload, no asset reuse, redistribution of the unchanged jar with credit, link to `LICENSE` |
| AI content | Nexus asks every page to declare generative AI use: tick it and say what for |
| Images | a banner of about 1400x400 and the gallery below, in 16:9 |

Files: none by hand. The release workflow creates one file per jar, named after its target
(`Living Horizon (Fabric 1.21.11)`, `(NeoForge 26.2.x)`, ...), with the loader and game
versions in its description, then adds a version to that same file on every release and
archives the previous one. The page's changelog gets the release notes once per release.
Renaming a file on Nexus makes the next release create a new one beside it.

## Description of the mod (both platforms)

Markdown. Modrinth takes it as is; on CurseForge, paste it in the editor and let it
format the headings and lists.

```markdown
# Living Horizon

**Living Horizon** shows mobs and players far past your render distance. It draws them on
the game's terrain and on the terrain of **Voxy** and **Distant Horizons**. It can also help
performance: you can lower your simulation distance and still see a living world.

> ⚠️ **This is a beta, so expect bugs.** I mainly play on 1.21.11 with Voxy, and it works
> there. I have not tested every loader and game version. Found a bug? Tell me on the
> [issues](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues) page or on the
> [Discord](https://discord.gg/THSV9dexNj). Thanks to anyone who helps!

## Features

### Mobs on the horizon

All mobs are visible from far away, on the game's terrain and **on Voxy and Distant
Horizons terrain**. This works for any entity Minecraft can draw, mobs and vehicles from
other mods included. Choose which ones in *Mobs & Entities...*.

Land nobody has explored yet has its animals too. The mod works out from the world's seed
which animals the game will put there. This needs the mod on the server, and works in
single player.

### Players at any distance

Other players are visible at any distance, with their gear and their mount.

**Players who logged off live on.** When a player logs off, a copy with their name appears
where they left. It walks around, sits, opens chests and sleeps at night, until the player
comes back.

### Birds in the sky

Birds fly over the land and are visible from far away: flocks, geese, birds of prey, gulls,
ducks, bats... They land on trees, buildings, fields and beaches.

## Performance

- **No AI far away.** Far entities play ready-made animations that fit the ground around
  them. Players who logged off and birds have a small AI only when you are close.
- **Simplified Entities.** Far mobs, vehicles and players are drawn as flat pictures instead
  of 3D models. It costs much less to draw, so you can show many more entities.
- **Everything runs on your computer.** The server only shares positions, so two players
  can see the same far mob doing different things.

Players who logged off are only visual: you walk through them, they cannot block or push
you, and mobs ignore them.

**Careful:** *Max Mobs* and *Mob Render Distance* both on *Unlimited* can crash the game.

## Multiplayer

Everything works in single player. On a server, some features need the mod on the server:

| Feature | Single player | LAN | Server with the mod | Server without the mod |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobs on the horizon | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Only the mobs you met |
| Players at any distance | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Players who logged off | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Only those you saw leave |
| Birds | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

To set up a server, put the same file in its `mods` folder. Nothing else to set up. Players
without the mod can still join. The server shares every player's position with the players
who have the mod: tell your players. Players in spectator mode or invisible are never shared.

The server writes `config/livinghorizon-server.json` the first time it starts. Edit it to
choose what it shares: players online, players who logged off, mobs, how far, with teammates
only, and which players and dimensions are never shared. Changes apply after a few seconds.

## Getting started

1. Install the file for your game version and loader. Voxy and Distant Horizons are optional.
2. Keep the default settings. *Restore Defaults* puts them back.

Open the settings from the Options screen, Mod Menu, Sodium's *Video Settings* or
`/livinghorizon config`.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.20 to 1.21.11 and 26.1 to 26.3.
- Fabric or Quilt (with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)), NeoForge or Forge.
- [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) or [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons): optional.
- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu): optional, on Fabric and Quilt.

## FAQ

### How it works

<details>
<summary>Is it only visual? Does it break mob farms?</summary>

It is only visual, no AI. The real mobs work as without the mod, so farms, spawning and the
mob cap do not change. You cannot hit a distant mob.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are the distant mobs real, or placed at random?</summary>

They are real mobs, where your game or the server last saw them. One that died or despawned
since can still show until you come near it. Then it is forgotten.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is it different from a higher simulation or entity distance?</summary>

A higher simulation distance makes the server run more real mobs, which costs a lot, and the
server still only sends them so far. Living Horizon draws copies that the server does not
run. They play ready-made animations, and far away they become flat pictures (*Simplified
Entities*).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How far does it show mobs and players?</summary>

Mobs: 512 blocks by default, up to *Unlimited* with *Mob Render Distance*. Players, boats and
vehicles: any distance by default, which *Player Render Distance* and *Entity Render Distance*
can limit. A mob only shows once your game or the server has seen it.

</details>

### Compatibility

<details>
<summary>Does it work with my mod?</summary>

Most likely. Voxy, Distant Horizons (2.3 and later), Sodium, Iris and shader packs work with
it; Photon and Complementary were checked. Living Horizon only adds its own figures: it does not change how other
mods draw the world. Mods not tested yet are listed under the
[`mod compatibility`](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/labels/mod%20compatibility)
label. If something breaks, open an
[issue](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues) with the mod's name and
version.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do mobs from other mods show far away?</summary>

Yes, as long as they use Minecraft's own entity system. If a mod's entities work too
differently, ask me to add support for it, in an
[issue](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues) or on the
[Discord](https://discord.gg/THSV9dexNj) :)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need Voxy or Distant Horizons?</summary>

No. Without them, distant mobs and players show on the game's own terrain, out to your
render distance. With one of them, they also show on its far terrain.

</details>

### Performance and settings

<details>
<summary>Will it lower my frame rate?</summary>

Drawing more entities costs frame rate. If your game slows down, keep *Simplified Mobs* and
*Simplified Entities* on and pick a lower *Preset*. *Max Mobs* and *Mob Render Distance* both on *Unlimited* can
crash the game.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I choose what is shown?</summary>

Yes. *Show Mobs*, *Show Players*, *Offline Players* and *Show Birds* turn each part on or
off. *Mobs & Entities...* chooses mob by mob.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it change my world or load chunks?</summary>

No. It changes nothing in your world and loads no chunk. It keeps what it remembers in files
of its own: in the `config` folder, and in `livinghorizon-positions.dat` in the world folder
for what the server shares. Removing the mod leaves your world as it was.

On a server, the mod only sends positions to the players who have it.

</details>

### Multiplayer

<details>
<summary>Does the server need the mod?</summary>

No. Almost everything works in single player, and you can join any server with it. But
players at any distance need the mod on the server, and the server then shares more mobs and
players who logged off. See *Multiplayer*.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work on Paper or Spigot servers?</summary>

You can play on them with the mod, as on any server without it. The server side runs on
Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge and Forge only, so a Paper or Spigot server shares nothing. A
plugin for Paper is discussed in
[#156](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/156).

</details>

<details>
<summary>I see no distant mobs or players. Why?</summary>

- Distant players need the mod on the server. Its owner may also limit who is shared.
- On a server without the mod, only the mobs you met show.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can it be used to cheat? Is it allowed on servers?</summary>

It only shows other players where the server allows it. Distant players only show on a
server that has the mod, and its owner chooses what it shares: how far, with teammates
only, and which players and dimensions stay hidden. `"sharePlayers": false` in the server's
settings turns it off. Invisible players and players in spectator mode are never shared.
Sneaking players are, for now
([#269](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/269)).

On other servers, you only see what your own game saw. The mod sends nothing to the server.
Each server has its own rules about mods, though: ask its staff.

</details>

### Downloads and license

<details>
<summary>Is there a Bedrock version?</summary>

No. Living Horizon is a mod for Minecraft Java Edition.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My game version is not supported. Will it be?</summary>

Tell me on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/THSV9dexNj) which version and loader you play.
It helps me choose what comes next.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I put it in a modpack?</summary>

Yes. Use the official file and credit it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if the project is abandoned?</summary>

The license plans for it. Once the project is declared abandoned (its GitHub repository
archived, or its README saying so), its license turns into the GPL: anyone may carry the project on,
with credit. See section 5 of the [LICENSE](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/blob/main/LICENSE).

</details>

### AI

<details>
<summary>Was it made with AI?</summary>

Yes. I am a full-stack developer, specialised in video games, and it is my job. I have made
mods since 2017: Call of Duty: Black Ops III maps such as
[Nuketown Zombies Legacy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2180904327),
with over a million downloads on the Steam Workshop (see my
[portfolio](https://clixmods.github.io/)). The ideas and the techniques come from game
development: impostors, LODs and ready-made animations are tricks games have used for years.
AI writes much of the code. I decide how the mod works, test it in the game and fix what
goes wrong. Without AI, a project this size would have taken me too long to make at all.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it on Modrinth? Why is it unlisted there?</summary>

It is on Modrinth, but unlisted: it does not show in Modrinth's search. Since August 2026,
[Modrinth's rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) do not allow a project made mainly
with AI to be public, so its staff unlisted it. CurseForge, Nexus Mods and the
[releases](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/releases) page have the same
files.

Unlisted does not mean unsafe. It is about how the mod is made, not about what it does:

- The code is public: anyone can read it on [GitHub](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon).
- GitHub builds every release from this code, and its build logs are public.
- The mod has no code of its own that connects to the internet. Player skins come from
  Mojang through the game, and the Discord link opens only when you click it.

</details>

## Made with AI

AI is part of this project's workflow: Living Horizon is made with [Claude](https://claude.ai).

The first image is the card in search results: it has to read at a glance.

1. A village on the far terrain (Voxy or Distant Horizons) in the distance with visible figures: villagers, animals, a golem.
2. A far-off player on a hill in front of far-terrain mountains, with their mount.
3. A flock of birds or geese in a V over a coastline, at sunset.
4. The settings screen (mobs and birds lists).
5. The same view with the mod off and on, side by side.
