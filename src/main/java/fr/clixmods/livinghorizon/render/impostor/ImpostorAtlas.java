/**
 * The pictures of the impostors, baked by the game's own renderers.
 *
 * <p>A <em>sheet</em> is one figure turned through {@link ImpostorViews#VIEWS} angles. Each
 * view is drawn the way the inventory draws a player (an orthographic picture of the
 * entity through its own renderer, so skins, armour, resource packs and other mods'
 * models are all followed), twice as large as a tile, into a small target.
 *
 * <p>The pictures are then read back and their mip levels worked out on the CPU
 * ({@link ImpostorPixels}), and written into a page that has real mip levels: the
 * graphics card picks and blends them as it does for any texture, so a figure a few pixels
 * tall is an average of its picture instead of a few pixels picked out of it, which would
 * flicker as it moves. The game's texture-to-texture copy cannot be used: it only copies
 * right at the corner of a texture, and stretches anything written anywhere else.
 *
 * <p>Baking is queued and done a little each frame: from 1.21.6 in the GUI pass, where the
 * game itself renders entities to textures, and the read back lands a frame or two later;
 * before, at the start of the frame, into a target of our own that the game takes for its
 * main one while a figure is drawn, and before 1.21.5 the eight views are drawn side by side
 * and read back at once ({@link BakeBackend}, one per range of versions). Everything here runs
 * on the render thread. Resource reloads throw the sheets away; they are read back from disk
 * when the packs are the same, baked again from the figures at hand otherwise.
 *
 * <p>Each kind of figure has pages of its own, one sheet per row, sized to the looks it
 * has: a cow with two looks takes a small page, villagers a few larger ones
 * ({@link SheetAllocator}). The mobs keep their sheets, from one world to the next, and on disk
 * from one game to the next ({@link ImpostorDisk}); the players' are thrown away once unused.
 *
 * <p>Besides entities, the mod's own figures are baked the same way ({@link ImpostorFigure}:
 * the 3D birds), drawn by the mod instead of an entity renderer, seen from the height the
 * figure asks for, and baked again each game rather than kept on disk.
