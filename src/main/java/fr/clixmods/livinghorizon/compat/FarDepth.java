/**
 * Voxy's terrain in the depth buffer while the entities are drawn, and only then: so that
 * a distant mob behind a Voxy tree is hidden by the tree, pixel by pixel, like any mob
 * behind any block.
 *
 * <p>Voxy writes its terrain's depth into the game's after drawing it - unless a shader
 * pack says not to, which Photon does ({@code excludeLodsFromVanillaDepth}): the pack
 * composites Voxy's terrain itself later, and finds it by where the game's depth is empty.
 * Leaving Voxy's depth there for the rest of the frame would break that. So, around the
 * one call that draws the entities:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>before: the depth is saved, then Voxy's own depth blit - the one it runs when a
 *       pack allows it - writes its terrain into it, and that state is saved too;</li>
 *   <li>the entities are drawn, tested against Voxy's terrain like against any block;</li>
 *   <li>after: wherever the depth is still what Voxy wrote, the saved one comes back;
 *       wherever an entity was drawn, its depth stays.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>From 26.1 the translucent parts of the entities have a step of their own, bracketed the
 * same way: see {@link #beforeTranslucent}.
 *
 * <p>Without a pack, Voxy already writes its depth for good and this does nothing.
 *
 * <p>Voxy's and Distant Horizons' own textures are read, never written, but for our own
 * figures' pixels: see {@link #intoVoxy()}. Voxy has no API for this: its classes are reached
 * by reflection, every GL state touched is put back, and any failure turns this off for the
 * session.
