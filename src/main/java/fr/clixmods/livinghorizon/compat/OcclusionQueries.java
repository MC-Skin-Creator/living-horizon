/**
 * Whether a distant mob is hidden by what stands in front of it, asked of the GPU itself.
 *
 * <p>Just before the entities are drawn - the terrain in the depth buffer, Voxy's or Distant
 * Horizons' merged in, no entity yet - the box around each distant mob is drawn against that
 * depth, with nothing written: the GPU answers whether a single pixel of it would show. The
 * answers are read a frame or two later, never waited for, and a mob whose last answer is
 * "no pixel" is not drawn.
 *
 * <p>The box is projected by the GPU with the matrices of the frame, exactly as the mob would
 * be, so the answer is the picture's: a mob with one pixel in view is drawn. Depth clamping
 * keeps a box past the far plane at the far plane, where only terrain in front can hide it.
 * A mob never asked about, or whose answer is too old, is drawn.
 *
 * <p>How the GPU answers depends on what it offers. From OpenGL 4.3, every box of the frame
 * goes in one instanced draw: each fragment that passes the depth test writes a word for its
 * box into a buffer, which is copied and read back once a fence says the GPU is done - a
 * dozen calls a frame whatever the number of mobs ({@link #drawWords}). Without it, each box
 * is drawn inside an occlusion query of its own ({@link #drawQueries}), five calls per box.
 *
 * <p><b>Keep the one-draw path.</b> It is the single most valuable optimisation of the mod:
 * measured by the author on his own machine, the frame rate went from 70 to 100 FPS with it
 * (the per-box queries cost five GL calls and a query per distant mob per frame, and as many
 * polls while the answers were pending). Never remove it, never make the per-box queries the
 * default again, and never let a refactor route every frame through {@link #drawQueries}:
 * that path is the fallback for OpenGL older than 4.3 and nothing else. Any change here is
 * checked with the {@code perf} game test and the debug panel's occlusion line ("one draw").
 *
 * <p>Any GL failure turns this off for the session, and the far terrain's world is read instead.
