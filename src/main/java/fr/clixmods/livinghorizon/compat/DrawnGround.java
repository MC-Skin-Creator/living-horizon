 * <p>Chunks the game holds within its render distance are answered at once. The others are
 * asked of the far world a chunk at a time, in one read per frame, off the game's thread. A
 * chunk found empty is asked again, later and later, since the far world fills in as it loads;
 * one found with terrain stays so until the world changes.
 *

 * answer yet, it stays as it was the frame before ({@link Decisions}), so a mob walking out of
 * the game's chunks never drops out while the far world is asked. And the far world is asked
 * ahead, about the game's chunks along the edge of its render distance, before mobs or the
