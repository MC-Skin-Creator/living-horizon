 * <p>The server sends a minecart 128 blocks away at most (8 chunks, two less than an
 * animal), but keeps moving it in every chunk within its simulation distance of a player,
 * 10 chunks by default. A minecart sent off along powered rails leaves the client while
 * the server still runs it: left where it was last seen, its copy would stand on the line
 * while the real one rolled on to the station.
 *
 * <p>This is the server's rail physics (the one every version uses unless the experimental
 * minecart changes are on), for an empty cart or one carrying a mob: slopes, curves,
 * powered rails, friction. Nothing collides and nothing is pushed. Off its rails, or out of
 * the blocks this client has, it stops.
