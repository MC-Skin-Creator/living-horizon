/**
 * Plays a remembered mob's animation in a loop: the one {@link MobPaths} chose from the
 * blocks around it, out of {@link MobAnimations}. Nothing is decided here; where the mob
 * is, which way it faces, whether it walks or grazes all come from the animation and the
 * clock. Every mob starts its loop at its own moment, drawn from its UUID, so a herd
 * does not move as one.
 *
 * <p>The one thing added to the animation: the mob never jumps. When where it should be
 * changes at once - the server's shared position moved it, or the real mob is sent again and the copy
 * hands over to it - it walks there in a straight line instead. And as the player comes
 * near enough for the real mob to be sent, the copy is called back to the spot where the
 * real one was last seen, so that the hand-over has little left to walk.
 *
 * <p>A mob the single player server still moves ({@link ServerMobs}) plays no animation: it
 * walks where the server has it, at the server's pace, and faces the way the real one faces.
 *
 * <p>Walks, or hops: a slime, a magma cube or a rabbit covers the same way in hops, as its
 * kind does ({@link MobGait}), and waits on the ground between two. A phantom or a ghast
 * flies instead, along its {@link MobFlight}, facing and tilted the way it goes.
