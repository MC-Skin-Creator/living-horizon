/**
 * Which of the {@link MobAnimations} a remembered mob plays, from the blocks around it.
 *
 * <p>The ground around the mob is read once, when it is remembered: in every column
 * within {@link #RADIUS} blocks, the floor nearest the mob's own height with room above
 * it, from the chunks loaded here or else from the far world (Voxy or Distant Horizons).
 * Both are read off the game's thread, the loaded chunks from a copy made as it is asked.
 * What has no collision - grass, flowers, crops, snow, torches - is air to a mob, and a
 * path dug with a shovel is ground like any other. Water, leaves and what stands too tall to step on (a fence, a
 * wall) are not.
 *
 * <p>Then every animation is laid on that ground, turned eight ways and mirrored: one
 * fits when all along it the ground is there and never climbs nor drops more than a
 * block at a time. The widest that fit are kept and one of them is chosen, by the mob's
 * UUID; with none, it stands and turns on the spot.
 *
 * <p>The far world may not be readable yet - Voxy and Distant Horizons open theirs a moment
 * after the game's, and have nothing of ground they never saw. A choice made with columns
 * missing says so ({@link Choice#complete()}), and the ground is read again later. A ground
 * read whole is saved with the mob ({@link Ground#save()}): the next time the world is
 * entered, the mob walks on it at once, whatever the far world knows.
