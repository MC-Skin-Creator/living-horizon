/**
 * What a server with the mod tells the clients with the mod: where every player is, and the
 * remembered mobs around the one it is sent to. Written with plain Java streams, no type of
 * the game's, so that it reads the same on every loader and version, and in a unit test.
 *
 * <p>Three kinds of message: {@link #PLAYERS} online, a few times a second; {@link #OFFLINE},
 * the players who logged off, and {@link #MOBS}, every few seconds, and all three at once to a
 * player who just joined. How a player looks ({@link Look}) and what they ride ({@link Mount})
 * come every few seconds only. The server keeps the same lists in the world
 * ({@link PositionPublisher}), written in this format too, under a version of its own
 * ({@link #FILE_VERSION}).
 *
 * <p>The layout, from version 3: the version it was written in and the oldest version that
 * reads it ({@link Format}), the kind of message, the table of the dimensions it names (their
 * ids, {@code minecraft:overworld}), then its records, each one after its length. A later
 * version may add fields at the end of a record, or after the records, and still be read here:
 * what this one does not know is skipped. Version 2, which numbered the dimensions 0 to 3, is
 * still read, from a server not updated yet and from the file. Version 4 adds a player gliding
 * with an elytra: a flag version 3 leaves unread, and their pitch at the end of the record.
