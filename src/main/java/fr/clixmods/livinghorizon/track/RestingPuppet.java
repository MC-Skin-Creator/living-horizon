/**
 * A player who logged off, drawn where they are. Their skin comes from a remembered profile,
 * not from the tab list. A picture on this client only: nothing is sent to the server, it
 * blocks nobody and nothing can hurt it.
 *
 * <p>With {@link FarConfig#offlineLife} on, it lives its life within
 * {@link FarConfig#offlineRoam} blocks of the spot where the player logged off - a village -
 * as long as the blocks there are loaded: it strolls, looks around, sits down, stands in
 * front of a chest, a crafting table or a villager's workstation; at night it walks to a bed
 * it can reach, or stays on its feet: never lying on the ground. Doors and fence gates it
 * walks through. Monsters in sight, it draws a sword and raises its shield, watches them and
 * keeps out of their way, never fights; safe indoors, behind walls and shut doors, it does
 * not mind them. A creeper blowing up in sight throws it back, shield up, and it walks back.
 * Hit, it raises its shield. At the water's edge it may fish for a while, a line cast, a
 * bobber bobbing and fish biting now and then; never two who are close by at the same time.
 * In lava or fire it shows fire resistance, under water water breathing. Where the blocks
 * are not loaded it only stands or sits where it was, standing at night.
 *
 * <p>When it rains, some of them - six in ten, always the same ones - walk to stand under a
 * roof or a tree they can reach, and stay there while it rains; the others go on as before.
 *
 * <p>In the evening it goes to stand in front of a campfire or a furnace it can reach, each
 * on a spot of its own.
 *
 * <p>Two of them close by may walk up to each other and chat a while, face to face, nodding
 * as they talk; never a third, and never another pair close by.
 *
 * <p>Look at it and it looks back at you; facing you, it crouches when you crouch. Walk into
 * it and it is shoved aside, as players push each other; it never pushes back, being a
 * picture on this client only.
 *
 * <p>Off, it sits on its spot. Either way it keeps to the ground: break what it rests on and
 * it falls; bury it and it reappears on top. Sitting, its own spot wins again once it has
 * room and something under it, since that is where the player will come back.
 *
 * <p>All of this only near the camera, within {@link #NEAR_IN} blocks: farther, no life of
 * its own any more, nothing read nor decided, it plays one of the animations distant mobs
 * play, in a loop around where its life left it, never farther from its spot than it roams
 * ({@link RestingLoop}): a walk with pauses, seated in some of them by day, in the bed it
 * already lies in at night.
 *
 * <p>A player who logged off riding something stays on it ({@link RestingMount}): with
 * {@link FarConfig#offlineLife} on, the horse walks, the boat rows and the happy ghast drifts
 * about the spot, the rider looking around; off, both wait on the spot. No bed, no chest
 * then, and no sword: hit, the rider raises a shield.
 *
 * <p>Never left in water: a player who logged off swimming or wading is on the nearest shore
 * within {@link #SHORE} blocks of their spot, living their life or playing their loop from
 * there, or, with no shore that near, in a boat on the surface, rowed as a mount is.
