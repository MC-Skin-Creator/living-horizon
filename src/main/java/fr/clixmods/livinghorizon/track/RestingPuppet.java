/**
 * A player who logged off, drawn where they are. Their skin comes from a remembered profile,
 * not from the tab list. A picture on this client only: nothing is sent to the server, it
 * blocks nobody and nothing can hurt it.
 *
 * <p>With {@link FarConfig#offlineLife} on, it lives its life within
 * {@link FarConfig#offlineRoam} blocks of the spot where the player logged off - a village -
 * as long as the blocks there are loaded: it strolls, looks around, sits down, stands in
 * front of a chest, a crafting table or a villager's workstation; at night it walks to a bed
 * it can reach, or lies down. Doors and fence gates it walks through. Monsters in sight, it
 * draws a sword and raises its shield, watches them and keeps out of their way, never
 * fights; safe indoors, behind walls and shut doors, it does not mind them. A creeper
 * blowing up in sight throws it back, shield up, and it walks back. Hit, it raises its
 * shield. In lava or fire it shows fire resistance, under water water breathing. Where the
 * blocks are not loaded it only stands, sits or sleeps where it was.
 *
 * <p>Off, it sits on its spot. Either way it keeps to the ground: break what it rests on and
 * it falls; bury it and it reappears on top. Sitting, its own spot wins again once it has
 * room and something under it, since that is where the player will come back.
 *
 * <p>All of this only near the camera, within {@link #NEAR_IN} blocks: farther, no life of
 * its own any more, nothing read nor decided, it plays one of the animations distant mobs
 * play, in a loop around its spot ({@link RestingLoop}): a walk with pauses, seated in some
 * of them, and lying down at night.
 *
 * <p>A player who logged off riding something stays on it ({@link RestingMount}): with
 * {@link FarConfig#offlineLife} on, the horse walks, the boat rows and the happy ghast drifts
 * about the spot, the rider looking around; off, both wait on the spot. No bed, no chest
 * then, and no sword: hit, the rider raises a shield.
 *
 * <p>Never left in water: a player who logged off swimming or wading is on the nearest shore
 * within {@link #SHORE} blocks of their spot, living their life or playing their loop from
 * there, or, with no shore that near, in a boat on the surface, rowed as a mount is.
