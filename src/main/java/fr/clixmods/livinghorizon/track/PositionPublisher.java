 * What a server with the mod tells the clients with the mod, so that they draw every player
 * at any distance, as they look and on what they ride, and the remembered mobs past what the
 * server sends them ({@link PositionsMessage}, received by {@link SharedPositions}).
 *
 * <p>Run by {@code MinecraftServerMixin} on every server: a dedicated one, and the one inside the
 * game of a player alone in their world or hosting it on LAN, whose own game reads it back like
 * any other. It touches nothing of the client, so a dedicated server can load it. A client
 * without the mod is sent nothing.
 *
 * <p>It keeps the last position of every player who logged off, with how they looked and the
 * mount they took away with them, and of the mobs in chunks no longer loaded, in a file of the
 * world ({@link #FILE}), so that a player who joins later sees them too. A mob is forgotten when
 * its chunk is loaded and it is not there any more.
