/**
 * Where the remembered mobs really are, in a single player world.
 *
 * <p>The server stops sending a mob well before it stops moving it: between the distance it
 * sends that kind at (160 blocks for an animal, less with the "Entity Distance" slider) and
 * the simulation distance (a square of chunks, farther still on its diagonals), the mob
 * grazes, wanders and walks to its bed while its copy stands where it was last seen. In a
 * single player world the server runs in this game: it is asked a few times a second where
 * those mobs are, and the copies follow them ({@link MobMotion}). On another server nothing
 * can be asked; the data pack is the way there.
