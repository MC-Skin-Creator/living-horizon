/**
 * The mobs this client has met, left where it last saw them once the server stops
 * sending them, doing a little loop of their own.
 *
 * <p>Nothing runs on the server and no AI runs here: a remembered mob is a copy that was
 * never added to the world, saved as the game saves it (so the horse keeps its coat,
 * the sheep its colour, the wolf its collar), that plays where it was an animation
 * chosen from the blocks around it ({@link MobPaths}, {@link MobMotion}): a stroll, a pause
 * to graze or look around, and back; a phantom or a ghast flies its own loop ({@link MobFlight}).
 * It is a picture of what lives there, not a simulation.
 * When the server sends the real mob again, the copy walks up to it first: the real one
 * is only drawn once the copy stands where it is.
 *
 * <p>In a single player world, where the server is right here, a remembered mob the server
 * still moves is followed instead ({@link ServerMobs}): the copy walks where the real one is.
 *
 * <p>Only mobs that stay put are worth remembering: animals do, hostile mobs despawn as
 * soon as nobody is around. Which ones is {@link FarConfig#mobTypes}, plus every mob with
 * a name tag ({@link FarConfig#rememberNamedMobs}), but never one of {@link FarConfig#hiddenMobs}.
 * A memory is dropped when the mob is seen dying, or when this client comes back within
 * range of where it was and it is not there any more.
 *
 * <p>Remembered per server across sessions, in {@code config/livinghorizon/mobs/<server>.json}.
