/**
 * Easter egg 6: now and then, day or night, far off in a forest anywhere around the player,
 * as far as the horizon, a big hairy figure walks across their line of sight, turns its head
 * to look at them once, walks on, and is gone as soon as something stands between them - a
 * trunk, a rock - or the player comes near. Only on this screen.
 *
 * <p>Its way is read in the loaded chunks or the far world ({@link Columns}): in a forest, on
 * ground, never on the leaves the far world shows over its trees, so out there it walks where
 * the ground shows (a clearing, the edge of the wood). Part of its way must be in sight
 * ({@link Sight}): in a forest too thick to see into (a jungle), a way all under the leaves
 * would never be seen. It starts out of sight where it can, and once it has been in sight a
 * while, the first obstacle that hides it is where it goes. The figure is drawn of boxes
 * ({@link BoxFigure}), in the light where it walks.
 *
 * <p>Secret: nothing a player reads (settings, README, changelog) says what it is.
