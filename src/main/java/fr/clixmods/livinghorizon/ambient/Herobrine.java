 * Easter egg 4: from the second or third day the player lives in a world, once a day, at any
 * moment of it, by day or by night, a figure in Steve's skin with white eyes stands somewhere
 * far off around them - up to 400 blocks - and watches them. Once they look him in the eyes he
 * is gone three to five seconds later, and does not come back for two to four days; until then
 * he comes back every day. He goes as well after ten minutes, or if they come near. Only on
 * this screen.
 *
 * <p>The figure is a player of no one, in the default skin the game picks from its id:
 * Steve's for {@link #STEVE}. The white eyes are two small boxes drawn over its face, the
 * size of the eyes of the skin, however far he stands. His
 * spot is read in the loaded chunks or the far world ({@link Columns}), and must be in
 * sight: through the loaded blocks, or past the far world's terrain ({@link LodWorld#blocked}).
 * His days are kept by the {@link EggCalendar}; he keeps out of the other easter eggs' way.
 *
 * <p>Secret: nothing a player reads (settings, README, changelog) says what it is.
