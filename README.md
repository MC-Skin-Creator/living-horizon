# Living Horizon

**Living Horizon** is a Minecraft mod that shows mobs and players far past your render
distance. It draws them on the game's terrain and on the terrain of **Voxy** and **Distant
Horizons**. It can also help performance: you can lower your simulation distance and still
see a living world.

> ⚠️ **This is a beta, so expect bugs.** I mainly play on 1.21.11 with Voxy, and it works
> there. I have not tested every loader and game version. Found a bug? Tell me on the
> [issues](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues) page or on the
> [Discord](https://discord.gg/THSV9dexNj). Thanks to anyone who helps!

## Features

### Mobs on the horizon

All mobs are visible from far away, on the game's terrain and **on Voxy and Distant
Horizons terrain**. This works for any entity Minecraft can draw, mobs from other mods
included. Choose which ones in *Mobs & Entities...*.

### Players at any distance

Other players are visible at any distance, with their gear and their mount.

**Players who logged off live on.** When a player logs off, a copy with their name appears
where they left. It walks around, sits, opens chests and sleeps at night, until the player
comes back.

### Birds in the sky

Birds fly over the land and are visible from far away: flocks, geese, birds of prey, gulls,
ducks, bats... They land on trees, buildings, fields and beaches.

## Performance

The mod uses two techniques to stay light.

### No AI far away

Far entities have no AI. They play ready-made animations that fit the ground around them.

- **Mobs**: no AI. They walk, graze and look around.
- **Players who logged off**: a small AI when you are close, so they use beds and chests.
  Ready-made animations when you are far.
- **Birds**: a small AI when you are close, ready-made flights when you are far.

Players who logged off are only visual. The world does not know they exist: you walk
through them, they cannot block or push you, and mobs ignore them.

### Simplified Entities

Many games draw far objects as **impostors**: a flat picture instead of a 3D model. Living
Horizon does the same for far mobs and players. It costs much less to draw, so you can show
many more entities.

Keep *Simplified Entities* on if you raise *Mob Render Distance* or *Max Mobs*. A *Preset*
(*Low*, *Normal*, *High*, *Ultra*) sets everything at once.

**Careful:** *Max Mobs* and *Mob Render Distance* both on *Unlimited* can crash the game.

### Everything runs on your computer

Your game handles the far animations, the players who logged off and the birds. The server
only shares positions. So two players can see the same far mob doing different things.

## Multiplayer

Everything works in single player. On a server, some features need the mod on the server:

| Feature | Single player | World opened to LAN | Server with the mod | Server without the mod |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mobs on the horizon | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Only the mobs you met |
| Players at any distance | — | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Players who logged off | ✓ | ✓ | ✓, even those who left before you joined | Only those you saw leave |
| Birds | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

- **Server**: put the same jar in the server's `mods/` folder (with the Fabric API on Fabric
  and Quilt). Nothing else to set up.
- **LAN**: nothing to do.
- Players without the mod can still join.
- The server shares every player's position with the players who have the mod. Tell your
  players.
- Players in spectator mode or invisible are never shared.

### Server settings

The server writes `config/livinghorizon-server.json` the first time it starts. Edit it to
choose what it shares. Changes apply after a few seconds, without a restart.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `sharePlayers` | `true` | Shares players online past the view distance |
| `playerRange` | `0` | How far a player is shared, in blocks. `0` is any distance |
| `teamsOnly` | `false` | Shares players with their own team only (`/team`) |
| `hideSpectators` | `true` | Never shares players in spectator mode |
| `hideInvisible` | `true` | Never shares invisible players |
| `hiddenPlayers` | `[]` | Names never shared, such as `["Steve"]` |
| `hiddenDimensions` | `[]` | Dimensions where nothing is shared, such as `["minecraft:the_nether"]` |
| `shareOfflinePlayers` | `true` | Shares players who logged off where they left |
| `shareMobs` | `true` | Shares the remembered mobs past the view distance |

These settings only change what the server sends. Within the view distance, players see
each other as usual. What a player's game saw on its own stays in its memory.

## Getting started

1. Install the file for your game version and loader (see *Requirements*). Voxy and Distant
   Horizons are optional.
2. Keep the default settings. *Restore Defaults* puts them back.

Open the settings from the Options screen, Mod Menu, Sodium's *Video Settings* (Sodium 0.8
and later) or `/livinghorizon config`.

## Useful commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/livinghorizon config` | Opens the settings |
| `/livinghorizon scan` | Scans the mobs around you again if needed. Single player only, and done on its own the first time you open a world. |

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.20 to 1.21.11 and 26.1 to 26.3.
- Fabric or Quilt (with [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)), NeoForge or Forge.
- [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy) or [Distant Horizons](https://modrinth.com/mod/distanthorizons): optional.

## FAQ

### How it works

<details>
<summary>Is it only visual? Does it break mob farms?</summary>

It is only visual. Distant mobs are copies drawn on your screen, with no AI. The real mobs
work as without the mod, so farms, spawning and the mob cap do not change. You cannot hit or
ride a distant mob. The birds are only visual too.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do distant mobs move? What happens when I come close?</summary>

They move. Each one plays ready-made animations that fit the ground around it: it walks a
few blocks, grazes and looks around. Happy ghasts and mannequins stand still at first: set
them to *Roaming* in *Mobs & Entities...*.

As you come close, the copy walks back to the real mob, and the real mob takes its place.
Most of the time you do not see the change.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Are the distant mobs real, or placed at random?</summary>

They are real mobs, where your game or the server last saw them. One that died or despawned
since can still show until you come near it. Then it is forgotten.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How is it different from a higher simulation or entity distance?</summary>

A higher simulation distance makes the server run more real mobs, which costs a lot, and the
server still only sends them so far. Living Horizon draws copies that the server does not
run. They play ready-made animations, and far away they become flat pictures (*Simplified
Entities*). So you see mobs much farther away, for much less. Sodium only draws the mobs the
server sends.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How far does it show mobs and players?</summary>

Mobs: 512 blocks by default, up to *Unlimited* with *Mob Render Distance*. Players: any
distance by default, which *Player Render Distance* can limit. A mob only shows once your
game or the server has seen it.

</details>

### Compatibility

<details>
<summary>Does it work with my mod?</summary>

Most likely. Voxy, Distant Horizons, Sodium, Iris and shader packs work with it (see
*Compatibility*). Living Horizon only adds its own figures: it does not change how other
mods draw the world. Mods not tested yet are listed under the
[`mod compatibility`](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/labels/mod%20compatibility)
label. If something breaks, open an
[issue](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues) with the mod's name and
version.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do mobs from other mods show far away?</summary>

Yes. Any mob the game can draw shows far away, modded ones included. Monsters are off at
first, from other mods as from the game: they despawn when nobody is near. Turn any mob on
or off in *Mobs & Entities...*.

- Mobs made with GeckoLib are not drawn far away on 1.21.2 to 1.21.8 yet
  ([#67](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/67)).
- Vehicles from other mods, such as planes, are not shown far away yet
  ([#257](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/257)).
- Create contraptions and Create: Aeronautics airships are not shown far away yet
  ([#267](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/267)).
- A server with the mod only shares the game's own mobs. Mobs from other mods show where
  you met them.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need Voxy or Distant Horizons?</summary>

No. Without them, distant mobs and players show on the game's own terrain, out to your
render distance. With one of them, they also show on its far terrain.

</details>

### Performance and settings

<details>
<summary>Will it lower my frame rate?</summary>

Drawing more entities costs frame rate. If your game slows down, keep *Simplified Entities*
on and pick a lower *Preset*. *Max Mobs* and *Mob Render Distance* both on *Unlimited* can
crash the game.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I choose what is shown?</summary>

Yes. *Show Mobs*, *Show Players*, *Offline Players* and *Show Birds* turn each part on or
off. *Mobs & Entities...* chooses mob by mob.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it change my world or load chunks?</summary>

No. It changes nothing in your world and loads no chunk. It keeps what it remembers in files
of its own: in the `config` folder, and in `livinghorizon-positions.dat` in the world folder
for what the server shares. Removing the mod leaves your world as it was.

On a server, the mod only sends positions to the players who have it: the players five
times a second, the rest every five seconds.

</details>

### Multiplayer

<details>
<summary>Does the server need the mod?</summary>

No. Everything works in single player, and you can join any server with it. Players at any
distance need the mod on the server, and the server then shares more mobs and players who
logged off. See *Multiplayer*.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Does it work on Paper or Spigot servers?</summary>

You can play on them with the mod, as on any server without it. The server side runs on
Fabric, Quilt, NeoForge and Forge only, so a Paper or Spigot server shares nothing. A
plugin for Paper is discussed in
[#156](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/156).

</details>

<details>
<summary>I see no distant mobs or players. Why?</summary>

- Distant players need the mod on the server. Its owner may also limit who is shared (see
  *Server settings*).
- On a server without the mod, only the mobs you met show.
- Monsters are off at first: turn them on in *Mobs & Entities...*.
- *Only Over Terrain* hides a mob where no terrain is drawn under it yet.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can it be used to cheat? Is it allowed on servers?</summary>

It only shows other players where the server allows it. Distant players only show on a
server that has the mod, and its owner chooses what it shares: how far, with teammates
only, and which players and dimensions stay hidden. `"sharePlayers": false` turns it off
(see *Server settings*). Invisible players and players in spectator mode are never shared.
Sneaking players are, for now
([#269](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/issues/269)).

On other servers, you only see what your own game saw. The mod sends nothing to the server.
Each server has its own rules about mods, though: ask its staff.

</details>

### Downloads and license

<details>
<summary>Is there a Bedrock version?</summary>

No. Living Horizon is a mod for Minecraft Java Edition.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are there so many files?</summary>

There is one file per game version and loader: take the one for yours. Every file is built
and checked automatically. I mostly play on 1.21.11 with Voxy myself, so reports on the
other versions help a lot.

</details>

<details>
<summary>My game version is not supported. Will it be?</summary>

Tell me on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/THSV9dexNj) which version and loader you play.
It helps me choose what comes next.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I put it in a modpack?</summary>

Yes. Use the official file, unchanged, and credit it: name Living Horizon and clixmods, and
link to this repository. Modified versions and forks are not allowed: send a pull request
instead (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).

</details>

<details>
<summary>What if the project is abandoned?</summary>

The license plans for it. Once the project is declared abandoned (this repository archived,
or the README saying so), its license turns into the GPL: anyone may carry the project on,
with credit. See section 5 of the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

</details>

### AI

<details>
<summary>Was it made with AI?</summary>

Yes. I make video games for a living: I worked on Terra Memoria, and I have made mods since
2017. The ideas and the techniques come from game development: impostors and ready-made
animations are tricks games have used for years. AI writes much of the code. I decide how
the mod works, test it in the game and fix what goes wrong. Without AI, a project this size
would have taken me too long to make at all.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Is it on Modrinth? Why is it unlisted there?</summary>

It is on Modrinth, but unlisted: it does not show in Modrinth's search. Since August 2026,
[Modrinth's rules](https://modrinth.com/legal/rules) do not allow a project made mainly
with AI to be public, so its staff unlisted it. CurseForge, Nexus Mods and the
[releases](https://github.com/MC-Skin-Creator/living-horizon/releases) page have the same
files.

Unlisted does not mean unsafe. It is about how the mod is made, not about what it does:

- The code is public: anyone can read it in this repository.
- GitHub builds every release from this code, and its build logs are public.
- The mod has no code of its own that connects to the internet. Player skins come from
  Mojang through the game, and the Discord link opens only when you click it.

</details>

## Made with AI

AI is part of this project's workflow: Living Horizon is made with [Claude](https://claude.ai).

You can use AI to contribute too, no problem. Just keep thinking about what it writes.
Claude works best here: it reads `CLAUDE.md` and the skills in `.claude/skills/`, which
describe how the project works.
