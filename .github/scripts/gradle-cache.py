"""Prints the keys and paths of the CI's Gradle caches, as GITHUB_OUTPUT lines.

Usage: gradle-cache.py <node>, or gradle-cache.py shared for the shared entry alone.

Two kinds of entries, both written by the cache workflow on develop only (the pull
requests into develop can read what develop writes; what a pull request writes only
serves that pull request, and 56 of them evicted each other from the 10 GB GitHub
gives a repository):

- shared: the plugins and libraries Gradle downloads, the wrapper and the compiled build
  scripts, one entry for every job;
- one per Forge and NeoForge node: Minecraft decompiled, patched and recompiled, which
  takes those loaders three minutes per node and seconds once cached. Keeping Loom's for
  Fabric and Quilt saves about ten seconds, which is not worth the room.

What a job only downloads (the JDKs and the game files Forge fetches, the game's sounds
and textures NeoForge fetches) is left out: downloading it again is quicker than keeping it.
What Forge's own Maven serves is the exception: it often leaves a download hanging, so
Forge's userdev jar and the tools beside it are kept with the node.

A key is a hash of the files that decide the entry's content. The mod's identity and
version (the "mod" keys of stonecutter.properties.toml) are left out: the release and
the pull request build stamp a new version on every merge.
